    <h1>Classic Spanish Sangria</h1>
    <p>
        This authentic sangria recipe is a terrific version of the popular wine drink. You can 
        add any fruit that you want, but I find that apples and pears absorb all the rum. This 
        one is not diluted with carbonated beverages. I have had much success with red Burgundy 
        wine and white rum, though spiced rum is nice too.
